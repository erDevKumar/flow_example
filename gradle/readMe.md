-Coroutine
-suspend function 
-launch
-async
-returning single object vs returning single value
-returning data through streams
-returning frequent update of the data
-suspend functions return single value of the data
-for stream: channels(send and receive)(Hot);  flows(emit and collect)(Cold)
-Hot channels: Producers keep posting data even if no consumer (data loss can happen)
-Cold flows: Producers don't start posting data, if no consumer (data loss won't happen)
-Hot streams has to be closed manually
-problem when producer is faster than consumer
-problem when consumer is faster than producer 
-cold flow: if all consumer removed, flow will be cancelled as well
 -flow operator: map,filter,buffer(before collection)
-withContext to change thread won't work(flowOn)
-exception handling on produce side:(catch)
-shared flow v/s state flow
